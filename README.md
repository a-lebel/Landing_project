## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Throughout this project, I deepened my understanding of responsive design, particularly how to manage overlapping elements effectively. One of the more challenging aspects was ensuring that phone image and the price card would overlap in smaller devices, and the go full bleed in mobile.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to focus on:

Advanced CSS Layouts: Further refining my skills with CSS Grid and Flexbox to handle more complex layouts.
Accessibility: Ensuring my projects are accessible to users with disabilities by following ARIA guidelines and improving keyboard navigation.
JavaScript Interactivity: Adding more dynamic elements using vanilla JavaScript or frameworks like React.

### Useful resources

- MDN Web Docs - Flexbox - This comprehensive guide helped me understand Flexbox, which I used extensively in this project.
- CSS-Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox - This guide provided clear examples and explanations that were invaluable when implementing the layout.
